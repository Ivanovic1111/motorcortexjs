motorcortexjs
=============

MotorCortex.js aspires to mimic the human brain's motor cortex by providing a new layer of software abstraction that handles and describes the movement of the various elements of an html application in a way that all timed effects doesn't interfere with the logic (decision making) layer of the software and plus each "transition" is treated as a matter of the whole application body and not of each element alone.
And all this with an easy and straight forward CSS-like syntax and a js API that respects and matches all the modern MV* javascript frameworks.
